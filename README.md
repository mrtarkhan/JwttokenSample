# JwttokenSample
This repository provides a simple console application that demonstrates how to generate a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) in C# without relying on any third-party libraries.

## Features
- Generates a JWT token with custom headers and payload.
- Computes the signature using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm.
- Validates the JWT signature

## Getting Started
To get started with the JWT Token Sample, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/mrtarkhan/JwttokenSample)
2. Build the console application using your preferred C# development environment.
3. Run the application and observe the generated JWT token.

## Usage
The Program.cs file contains the code for generating and validating the JWT token. You can modify the code to customize the headers, payload, and secret key according to your requirements. BUT DO NOT USE IT FOR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.

Feel free to explore the jwt.io to learn more about JWT and its applications.
